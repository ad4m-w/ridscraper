<h1 align="center">OpenTable RID Scraper</h1>

<p align="center">Python Script that scrapes OpenTable restaurant RIDs, and saves them to a CSV file.</p>

<hr>

1.   Compile the code using Python
2.   (Optionally) Run the pre-compiled EXE
3.   Save the links in a CSV file (template provided)
4.   Run script, select CSV file and wait.
5.   RIDs will be saved in the CSV file next to the property name
6.   (Apologies if this violates Opentables TOS, just sharing something I created to make my life easier)
